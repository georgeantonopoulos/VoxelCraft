## Initial Concept

A voxel-based terrain engine built with React Three Fiber, featuring procedurally generated organic terrain, real-time physics, and dynamic environmental simulation.

## Target Audience

The primary users of VoxelCraft will be game developers and hobbyists who are interested in voxel-based environments, with a focus on creating an actual game rather than just a tech demo.

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to build a specific game experience. This experience will be centered around an awe-inspiring world with realistic physics. The gameplay will involve a realistic crafting experience where crafting and survival elements reveal clues and surprises, contributing to an overarching sense of mystery.

## Core Features

-   **Awe-Inspiring World:** Procedurally generated, organic-looking voxel terrain that encourages exploration.
-   **Realistic Physics:** A physics engine that provides a believable and immersive experience.
-   **Realistic Crafting:** A crafting system that is not just a menu, but an experience in itself.
-   **Mystery and Discovery:** The game will not have a clear, upfront goal. Instead, the narrative will unfold as the player interacts with the world, crafts items, and survives.

## Visual Identity

The game will aim for a realistic visual style, with high-fidelity textures and lighting. However, this will be balanced with the need for a smooth framerate and a good user experience across a variety of devices.
